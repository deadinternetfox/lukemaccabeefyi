A stray dog I pet and fed in the departure terminal in the airport of Belgrade, Serbia. When I traveled in Balkans many stray dogs had good sense about  me and would follow me but not others, I brought food for them and took few to vet. I have experience in reading dogs behaviours and understand some dogs may be unpredictable.
